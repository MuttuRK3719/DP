Input: processorTime = [8,10], tasks = [2,2,3,1,8,7,4,5]

Output: 16

Explanation:

Assign the tasks at indices 4, 5, 6, 7 to the first processor which becomes available at time = 8, and the tasks at indices 0, 1, 2, 3 to the second processor which becomes available at time = 10. 

The time taken by the first processor to finish the execution of all tasks is max(8 + 8, 8 + 7, 8 + 4, 8 + 5) = 16.

The time taken by the second processor to finish the execution of all tasks is max(10 + 2, 10 + 2, 10 + 3, 10 + 1) = 13.

public int minProcessingTime(List<Integer> processorTime, List<Integer> tasks) {
        Collections.sort(processorTime);
        Collections.sort(tasks, (a, b) -> b - a);
        int ans = 0, j = 0;

        for (int time : processorTime) {
            int count = 0;
            while (count < 4 && j <= tasks.size()) {
                count++;
                ans = Math.max(ans, time + tasks.get(j));
                j++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
